# Recipe Site - HTML Project

Welcome to my Recipe Site project! This is a simple web application where I'll showcase a collection of my favorite recipes. The site is being built from scratch using HTML, and as I learn more, I'll be adding styling (CSS) and interactivity (JavaScript).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a basic recipe website where users can easily browse through recipes. At first, I’ll focus on:

- Displaying a list of recipes with their titles, descriptions, ingredients, and instructions.
- Creating easy-to-navigate pages.
- (Eventually) adding search functionality to filter recipes.

## What I’m Aiming to Learn

As I work through this project, I’m not just trying to make a recipe site—I want to build the skills and mindset of a problem solver and coder. Here’s what I’m focusing on:

1. **Understanding HTML**: I’m starting with the basics: learning how to structure a webpage with HTML tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, and `<article>`. I’ll also get used to the layout of a typical webpage.
   
2. **Problem-Solving Mindset**: Coding is about solving problems step-by-step. As I build this site, I’ll think through the process logically: What content needs to go on the page? How will users interact with it? How do I make the site clean and functional?

3. **Iterative Improvement**: I’m going to start with a simple, basic version of the site, and as I get better at coding, I’ll refine the design, add features, and optimize the user experience.

4. **Debugging and Troubleshooting**: I know that things won’t always go as planned. Debugging is a big part of learning how to code, so I’m embracing it as an opportunity to grow and understand how things work under the hood.

## How I’m Tackling This Project

### Step 1: **Define the Problem**
The first step is figuring out what the project is all about: I want a recipe site where I can display my favorite recipes, and where users can easily navigate between them. I break this down into smaller tasks, such as:
- What should each recipe page include?
- How do I organize the recipes so they’re easy to browse?

### Step 2: **Break It Down**
I’ll divide the project into smaller pieces:
- A homepage to display a list of recipes.
- Individual recipe pages with details like ingredients, steps, and photos.
- A navigation bar to move between sections.
- (In the future) A search bar to filter recipes by ingredients or categories.

### Step 3: **Start Simple**
I’ll start with a basic version: just a homepage with a list of recipes, each with a title, ingredients, and a short description. No styling at first—just getting the structure right.

### Step 4: **Iterate and Improve**
Once the basics are in place, I’ll start improving:
- Add CSS for styling and make the site responsive.
- Implement JavaScript to add interactivity (like search or sorting).
- Continuously improve the site based on what I’ve learned so far.

## What’s Coming Next

Right now, my focus is on getting the basic structure and functionality of the site working. But in the future, I want to:

- Improve the design with CSS to make the site more visually appealing.
- Add a search bar so users can find recipes based on ingredients.
- Make the site mobile-friendly and responsive across different devices.

## Contributing

I’m still learning, but if you want to suggest improvements or contribute in any way, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Feedback is always welcome!

## Acknowledgments

Big thanks to all the online resources and tutorials that have helped me learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so far. I’m excited to continue learning and building!
