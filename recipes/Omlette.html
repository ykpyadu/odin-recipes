    <p>This easy, fail-proof omelette recipe is truly the best. 
        With a variety of filling suggestions, 
        you will learn how to make an omelet at home that’s even 
        more delicious than your favorite breakfast restaurant (but so simple)!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Salted Butter.</b> Unsalted and gee are good substitutes. You can also use olive oil, although I don’t recommend it
                     because you loose that buttery, salty exterior which is just divine.</li>
                <li><b>Eggs.</b> Use organic, pasture-raised, large brown eggs for the best results.</li>
                <li><b>Shredded Cheddar Cheese. Choose your favorite cheese.</b> 
                    We prefer sharp cheddar, but other suggestions include: gouda, mozzarella, Colby Jack, etc.</li>
            </ul>  
        <h3>Steps</h3> 
            <ol>
                <li>Begin by whisking the eggs vigorously until they are homogenous (uniform throughout).</li>
                <li>Then, whisk in the salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Next, melt the butter in an 8” nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. It’s very important that you use an 8″ pan. 
                    If you use a larger pan the omelet will be too thin, a smaller pan will yield a very thick omelet..</li>
                <li>Then, add the whisked eggs
                     and swirl them in the pan until they are evenly distributed.</li>
                <li>Next, cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs begin to set. Please don’t rush the process, low heat is important when cooking omelettes so they don’t overcook.</li>

            </ol>
            <p>Once they begin to set, use a spatula to gently push the edges in slightly and swirl the pan so that any uncooked eggs on the top pour over the sides to the edges of the pan and cook.
                Once the omelette is mostly set (about 5-6 minutes), carefully flip it and turn off the heat.</p>
