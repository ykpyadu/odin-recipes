            <h4>Chicken Masala</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Let's prep the ingredients for biriyani masala. 
                    Thinly slice the onions.</li>
                <li>Heat a cup of oil in a large pan. Once the oil is hot, lower the flame, 
                    and add the sliced onions to fry. Stir occasionally</li>
                <li>Give the green chilies, ginger, 
                    and garlic a quick blitz to make a coarse paste.</li>
                <li>Slow-cook the onions till they turn brown, 
                    and add the ginger-garlic-chili paste.</li>
                <li>Combine well, and cook for a few minutes. 
                    Now add the chopped tomatoes, and continue cooking.
                    Cook the tomatoes until they disappear into the mix.
                    Now add chopped coriander leaves and mint leaves. Mix well, and cook for 2-3 minutes.
                    Now add the marinated chicken pieces, two tablespoons yogurt, and salt to the pan. Mix gently to get chicken pieces evenly coated with the onion masala in the pan.</li>
                <li>Powder cinnamon, cardamom, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, and nutmeg to a coarse powder. 
                    This is our garam masala powder.</li>
                <li>Open the lid, add the garam masala to the cooked chicken, mix well, 
                    and cook for another 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Switch off the flame. That completes the first part of our biriyani - the chicken masala. Make sure that the 
                    chicken masala is moist enough so that biriyani won't go dry when we add rice later.</li>
            </ol>
                <h4>Cooking rice</h4>
                <ol>
                <li>In another pan heat 3 tablespoons oil and 3 tablespoons ghee on a medium flame. Fry 2 sliced onions, raisins, 
                    and cashew nuts until the onions turn brown.</li>
                <li>Lower the flame. Scoop them out, and leave them on a paper towel to soak up the extra oil.
                    Add the whole spices to the same pan and give them a quick fry.Drain off the water from the rice, and add it to the pan. Stir gently, and fry to get the rice to a crispy texture.
                    Add boiling water to the pan to cook the rice your are using. 
                    Squeeze one lime, add salt, and mix well.
                </li>
                <li>Switch off the flame once the rice is cooked just enough.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now layer the biriyani with chicken masala and the rice alternatingly. cook it it on low flame for 5 minutes and your biriyani is ready</p>
